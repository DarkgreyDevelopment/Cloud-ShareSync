## Description:
Cloud-ShareSync is an open source cloud storage backup application.

The long term goal of this project is to build a backup application, akin to [OneDrive](https://onedrive.com), that extends the Files On Demand/Fuse functionality to new public cloud storage providers. Supporting platforms such as linux and MacOS is also a priority.  

Cloud-ShareSync (v1.x) will have a much more limited scope. The project consists of two separate applications; [SimpleBackup](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com/api/Cloud_ShareSync.SimpleRestore.html) and [SimpleRestore](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com/api/Cloud_ShareSync.SimpleBackup.html).  

SimpleBackup and SimpleRestore are both console applications that run on Windows[*](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com/articles/Testing.html "Windows is tested on Windows Server 2022."), Linux[*](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com/articles/Testing.html "Linux is tested on Ubuntu latest."), and MacOS[*](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com/articles/Testing.html "MacOS is tested on macOS 11 Big Sur.").  


<br>


### SimpleBackup:
SimpleBackup is a backup app that can recursively search through a directory tree and upload files to a preconfigured [BackBlaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html) cloud storage bucket. SimpleBackup also offers optional file compression and encryption prior to upload.  
A complete feature list can be found [here](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com/articles/SimpleBackupFeatures.html).  

### SimpleRestore:
SimpleRestore is a complete restore app that takes the database output from SimpleBackup and uses it to download files and restore them to the path specified in the config. File decompression/decryption is also supported after download.  
A complete feature list can be found [here](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com/articles/SimpleRestoreFeatures.html).

## Documentation:
Project documentation can be found at [docs.cloud-sharesync.com](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com).  

### Getting Started:
Cloud-ShareSync runs on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Additionally container images are also available.  

Please refer to the [How-To Articles](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com/articles/HowTo/index.html) before opening any [issues](https://github.com/DarkgreyDevelopment/Cloud-ShareSync/issues).  

### Initial Setup:
- [Windows Setup](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com/articles/HowTo/WindowsSetup.html).
- [Linux Setup](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com/articles/HowTo/LinuxSetup.html).
- [MacOS Setup](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com/articles/HowTo/MacOsSetup.html).
- [Docker container setup](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com/articles/HowTo/DockerSetup.html).

## Roadmap:
The project [planning & development board](https://github.com/orgs/DarkgreyDevelopment/projects/3) is where the specifics of the roadmap can be found. Cloud-ShareSync is currently in a pre-release state and will follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) upon release.  

### Pre-Release/Phase 01:  
  - Status  : In Progress.  
  - Goal    : Establish initial functional backup and restore functionality.  
  - Features:  
    - A single config file controls all application settings.  
    - Console logging and rolling log files are enabled by default.
	- OpenTelemetry trace logging is also available when enabled.  
    - Application data can be stored in either a local Sqlite database or a remote postgres database.  
    - Backup application is a simple console app.
      - Files are uploaded to a BackBlaze B2 bucket.  
        - BackBlaze B2 bucket specified by user in config.  
      - When the backup application is run repeatedly; Files that were uploaded to the bucket on prior runs will be skipped if they are unchanged.  
      - Optionally compress files before upload.  
        - You may also elect to have a unique password generated during the compression process to password protect compressed files.  
        - File compression has a [dependency on 7-Zip](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com/articles/7ZipDependency.html).
      - Optionally encrypt files before upload.  
        - File encryption depends on [ChaCha20Poly1305 platform support](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com/api/Cloud_ShareSync.Core.Cryptography.FileEncryption.ManagedChaCha20Poly1305.html).
    - Restore application is a simple console app.  
      - Downloads all files from BackBlaze B2 that were uploaded by the the backup application.  
      - When the restore process is run repeatedly; Files that were downloaded from the bucket on prior runs will be skipped if they are unchanged.  
      - Decompresses files after download if they are compressed.  
      - Decrypts the encrypted files after download.  

### Phase 02:  
  - Status  : Developing Acceptance Criteria.  
  - Goal    : Build Selective Restore Application  
  - Features:  
    - All phase 01 features retained.  
    - Selective restore must be a GUI application.  
    - Selective restore will present a table/spreadsheet like view of previously uploaded files and will restore files upon selection.

### Phase 03:  
  - Status  : Developing Acceptance Criteria.  
  - Goal    : Add additional cloud providers.  
  - Features:  
    - Retain features from all previous phases.  
    - Add ability to upload/download files to/from [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs).  
    - Add ability to upload/download files to/from [Aws S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3).  
    - Add ability to upload/download files to/from [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage).  

### Phase 04:  
  - Status  : Developing Acceptance Criteria.  
  - Goal    : Combine SimpleBackup, SimpleRestore, and SelectiveRestore into a single app.  
  - Features:  
    - Unified application should run as a background service.  
    - Unified application should have an associated management GUI.  
      - Management GUI should primarily allow input of app settings.  
      - GUI should also contain the SelectiveRestore menu.  

### Phase 05:  
  - Status  : Developing Acceptance Criteria.  
  - Goal    : Add Files On Demand/FUSE functionality.  
  - Features:  
    - Feature set TBD.  
  - Reference Docs: 
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/cfapi/cloud-files-api-portal
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/cfapi/build-a-cloud-file-sync-engine

### Phase 06:  
  - Status  : Developing Acceptance Criteria.  
  - Goal    : Enable multi device support.  
  - Features:  
    - Feature set TBD.
