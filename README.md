## Description:
Cloud-ShareSync is an open source cloud storage backup and restore application.

The long term goal of this project is to build a backup application, akin to [OneDrive](https://onedrive.com), that extends the Files On Demand/Fuse functionality to new public cloud storage providers. Supporting platforms such as linux and MacOS is also a priority.

Cloud-ShareSync (v1.x) will have a much more limited scope. The application currently (v0.7.0-PreRelease) has two separate modes of operation; Backup and Restore.

Cloud-ShareSync runs on Windows[*](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com/articles/Testing.html "Windows is tested on Windows Server 2022."), Linux[*](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com/articles/Testing.html "Linux is tested on Ubuntu latest."), and MacOS[*](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com/articles/Testing.html "MacOS is tested on macOS 11 Big Sur.").

## Roadmap:
The project [planning & development board](https://github.com/orgs/DarkgreyDevelopment/projects/3) is where the specifics of the roadmap can be found.  
Cloud-ShareSync is currently in a pre-release state and will follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) upon release.

### Phase 01 - V0.7:
  - Status  : Nearing Completion.
  - Goal    : Establish initial backup and restore functionality.
  - Features:
    - Backup / Restore modes are specified by passing in arguments via the commandline.
      - Ex: `Cloud-ShareSync.exe backup`
      - Ex: `Cloud-ShareSync.exe restore`
    - A config file controls the the remaining application settings.
    - Console logging and rolling log files are enabled by default.
	- OpenTelemetry trace logging is also available when enabled (currently partially enabled).
    - Application data can be stored in a local Sqlite database.
    - Application can run in either console or GUI mode. 
    - Files can be uploaded/downloaded to/from a BackBlaze B2 bucket.
      - BackBlaze B2 bucket specified by user in config.
    - When the backup mode is run repeatedly; Files that were uploaded to the bucket on prior runs will be skipped if they are unchanged.
    - Files can be compressed before upload.
      - You may also elect to have a unique password generated during the compression process to password protect compressed files.
      - File compression has a [dependency on 7-Zip](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com/articles/7ZipDependency.html).
    - Files can be encrypted prior to upload.
      - File encryption depends on [ChaCha20Poly1305 platform support](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com/api/Cloud_ShareSync.Core.Cryptography.FileEncryption.ManagedChaCha20Poly1305.html).
    - Restore mode uses the database to restore all files that were uploaded to BackBlaze B2 by the the backup application.
    - Restore mode will decompresses files after download if they were compressed during the upload process.
    - Restore mode decrypts files after download if they were encrypted during the upload process.

### Phase 02 - v0.8:
  - Status  : Solidifying Acceptance Criteria.
  - Goal    : Add Azure Blob Storage, Postgres, and Selective Restore functionality
  - Features:
    - Add ability to upload/download files to/from [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs).
      - Backup process can archive to both BackBlazeB2 and Azure Blob Storage simultaneously.
      - Restore mode requires specifying which cloud provider to restore files from.
    - Enable Postgres alternative DB functionality.
      - Postgres OR Sqlite. Not both.
    - Add selective restore GUI option.
      - Selective restore GUI will present a table/spreadsheet like view of previously uploaded files.
      - Allows the user to restore individual files from either configured cloud provider.

### Phase 03 - v0.9:
  - Status  : Developing Acceptance Criteria.
  - Goal    : Add "Sync" functionality & convert to background service.
  - Features:
    - Application needs to combine backup and restore modes into an always on "Sync" mode.
    - Application should run as a background service.
    - Application should (continue to) have an associated management GUI.
      - Management GUI should primarily allow input of app settings.
      - GUI should also contain the SelectiveRestore menu.

### Phase 04 - Pre-1.0 Release:
  - Status  : Developing Acceptance Criteria.
  - Goal    : Focus on code quality and tests.


### Beyond:
  - Status  : Developing Acceptance Criteria.
  - Goal    : Add additional cloud providers & Add Files On Demand/FUSE functionality.
  - Features:
    - Add ability to upload/download files to/from [Aws S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3).
    - Add ability to upload/download files to/from [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage).
