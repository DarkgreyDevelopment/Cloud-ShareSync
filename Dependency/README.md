# Dependency
For compression this application has a dependency on 7Zip (https://www.7-zip.org/) v19.00.  
The backup utility currently expects the 7z.exe & 7z.dll files to be available in the dependency folder.  
1. Download 7Zip for windows (https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)
2. Extract both 7z.exe and 7z.dll files from the main installer
3. Copy both to the Dependency folder prior to first use of Cloud-ShareSync.
    a. You can also configure the dependency path using the appsettings.
