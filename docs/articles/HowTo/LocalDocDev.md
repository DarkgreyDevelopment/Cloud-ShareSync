# Local Documentation Development

[Docs.Cloud-ShareSync.com](https://docs.cloud-sharesync.com) is hosted on github pages and is generated by docfx from markdown pages housed in the [github repository](https://github.com/DarkgreyDevelopment/Cloud-ShareSync). API documentation is also generated from XML documentation in the code itself.  

Documentation changes can be tested locally prior to pushing to any commits to github.  
To host the docs page locally you must
1. Download a copy of [DocFX](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/releases/latest/download/docfx.zip) and extract it.
2. Clone the repo `git clone https://git.cloud-sharesync.com`
3. Generate API metadata: `docfx.exe metadata Cloud-ShareSync\docs\docfx.json`
4. Serve the website `docfx.exe Cloud-ShareSync\docs\docfx.json -t templates/CloudShareSync --serve`
