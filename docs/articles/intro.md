# About The Developer

Hello and welcome!  
Cloud-ShareSync is developed by me, [Taylor Marvin](https://github.com/tsmarvin). I am a native-born [Arizonian](https://www.abc15.com/news/state/arizonan-vs-arizonian-which-one-is-right) but am currently living in Washington state.

I work full time as software developer/IT professional and enjoy tinkering with technology in my spare time.  
Aside from working on software I'm a big fan of electronic music of all kinds and enjoy traveling to concerts around the world.  
I also enjoy hiking, camping, and being outdoors in general.
